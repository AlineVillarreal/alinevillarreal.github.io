# **About me**

I am an Associate Professor at the Physicochemistry Department at the School of Chemistry  of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Also, I am one of the Fellows of the Science, Technology and Policy program of the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research.

I did my Ph. D. in chemical engineering at the School of Chemistry of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), were I also studied my master's and bachelor's degrees in chemical engineering. I have been researching heterogeneous catalysis and other porous materials.  
I have done two postdoctoral research stays; the first in the Molecular Spectroscopy Laboratory in Santa FÃ©, and a second one in the National School of Engineering and Extractive Industries in Mexico. Between 2019 and 2021 I worked as a Science-Policy Fellow at the Ministry of Environment of Mexico City Government as a liaison between policymakers and academia.
