# **About me**


I did my Ph. D. in chemical engineering at the School of Chemistry of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), were I also studied my master's and bachelor's degrees in chemical engineering. I have been researching heterogeneous catalysis and other porous materials.  
I have done two postdoctoral research stays, the first in the Molecular Spectroscopy Laboratory in Santa FÃ©, and a second in the National School of Engineering and Extractive Industries in Mexico. 
Currently, I work as a Science-Policy Fellow at the Ministry of Environment of Mexico City Government as a liaison between policymakers and academia.
